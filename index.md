## About Me


![Profile Picture]({{ "assets/images/verena.jpg" | relative_url }}){: class="profile-image"}

 
My name is {{ site.name }}, and I am a senior studying Mechanical Engineering at Cornell University. My internships and experiences at Cornell so far have been focused on space and space exploration, as that is the career I want to pursue full-time. I am also interested in Aeronautics, which I am gaining more experience with through my aerospace-focused coursework at Cornell.

My experiences so far have included three internships, plus extensive research work as a part of the Space Systems Design Studio research lab under Professor Mason Peck. My first internship was over the summer of 2023, where I worked at NASA-JPL as a Spacecraft Mechanical Engineer. As an intern, I was a member of the Separations team that was in the process of developing and testing the hardware needed for Entry, Descent, and Landing of the Mars Sample Return Lander. In the summers of 2024 and 2025, I worked at SpaceX on the Propulsion Components team for the Dragon Vehicle. While at Cornell, I led the Sailing to the Stars team, which designed hardware to test free-flying light sails, that launched to the International Space Station on August 1st, 2025.
