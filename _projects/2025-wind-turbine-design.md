Through the MAE4272 class at Cornell University, I was tasked to work with a group of students to design a wind turbine blade. Specifically, to design a wind turbine blade that can be tested using the wind tunnel facilities on campus. This creates some constraints for the design, including the maximum length of the blade - which is limited by the wind tunnel test section dimensions - as well as restrictions on the maximum torque that can be generated and the expected wind velocities the blade needs to work at. With all these constraints, the overall goal of this project was to maximize the power output of the wind turbine through carefully designed blades.

With the help of ChatGPT, Matlab code was put together in order to take in the design and material constraints, and output the functions for chord length and twist as a function of the span of the blade. The inputs needed for this program are the material properties, the constraints previously defined, and the selected airfoil properties. The airfoil selected was the E387, which was selected due to its high lift-to-drag ratio, manufacturability, and higher power generation. With that airfoil selected, we then could work through the optimization procedure, as summarized in the graphic below.

Once we finished the CAD for the wind turbine blade, we then had the blades 3D printed and shipped to us for testing within the wind tunnel.

The testing procedure we created was designed to ideally get us as much data as we could get to compare against our theoretical calculated power output, while working in careful steps to make sure we would not risk damaging the torque brake used to determine power outputs from the wind turbine. See the flowchart for testing below.

Once the blades were tested, we then pivoted to post-analysis of the data. We calculated the average power generated by the wind tunnel across the weibull wind velocity distributon, and got a value of 0.103 W, which is approximately an order of magnitude smaller than what we designed. The power curve data collected, plus the comparison of max power at each wind velocity vs the weibull distribution are shown below.

For this project, my contribution consisted of leading the effort to create the code and procedure to optimize our blade design, as well as refining the testing procedure based on feedback from instructors.
